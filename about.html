    <h3>Our History</h3>

    <p>The Digital Literacy Foundation of Florida was founded with a vision to bridge the digital divide and ensure that everyone, regardless of age, income, or background, has access to essential digital literacy skills. Our journey began in 2024, when a group of passionate educators, tech enthusiasts, and community leaders recognized the growing importance of digital literacy in an increasingly connected world.</p>

    <p>Starting as a small initiative in Orlando, FL, we focused on offering basic computer classes to underprivileged communities. The positive impact was immediate, encouraging us to expand our reach and programs.</p>

    <p>As we continue to grow, the Digital Literacy Foundation of Florida remains committed to our core values of inclusivity, empowerment, and community engagement. We are proud of our history and excited for the future, as we work tirelessly to ensure that everyone has the tools they need to succeed in the digital age.</p>
